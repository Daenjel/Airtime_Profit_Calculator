   It is important for any type of business to keep track of stock and profit. Airtime profits are among the difficult aspects to keep track of.
   By developing airtime profit calculator app, it will be easier for business people to have accurate data of their airtime sales. The app
   herein seeks to compute value of daily and periodic airtime purchase so as to help determine period sales, thus computing profits from
   airtime sales both on a daily basis as well as annually. This app will be a great asset as it will help the business people to calculate 
   daily or periodic refills needed from wholesalers. Furthermore it will help to keep track of the fluctuating wholesale prices of the 
   different airtime companys. Therefore profits of close of business daily will be effectively isolated.
